## Exploratory Data Analysis 

The first project in **Exploratory Data Analysis** requires us to reproduce four plots. The original plots are located in the **figures** folder. 


To reproduce one of the plots: run the code from the project directory. Each file requires the `Load Data.R` file which gets the data and cleans it. The `filtered data` is then ready to create the subsequent plots.  

The plots are also stored in the directory as png files.
